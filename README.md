## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The python notebook files in this repo should run with Anaconda distribution of Python versions 3.*.

To explore this project please download the dataset (iris.csv) and the python notebook.

You can either upload the files using Jupyter notebook which will automatically place these files in the current working directory of your Python installation or place these files in the current working directory and then run the notebooks.

Hint: To check for the current working directory using the available notebooks just type os.getcwd() in a cell and run it. If you would like to change the current working directory before running these notebooks, use the os.chdir function, e.g. if your current working path is c:\projects, the statement you would want to execute is os.chdir("c:&#92;&#92;projects").

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in learning the concepts of DeepLearning from scratch.

We will begin with the simplest Neural Network the Perceptron and explore our way to building a gigantic DeepLearning network to do Image processsing.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are two main files in this repo.
1. iris.csv - The dataset we will start exploring.
2. Perceptron.ipynb - The first python notebook to begin our journey to master DeepLearning concepts.
